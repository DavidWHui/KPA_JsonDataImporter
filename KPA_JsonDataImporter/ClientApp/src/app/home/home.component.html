<h1>KPA Example Project</h1>

<p>Check the README.md for more notes on what I could expand upon, also see the example.json file to see the formatting for this importer</p>
<p>As we are mapping to the "ExampleModel.cs". More models could be added to be able to import different data types, as well as a possible non-strict</p>
<p>json data format as possible expansions to this project depending on direction.</p>

<p>Navigate to Import Json to get started</p>
